**Problem**: Presence of malicious node.

DeGitX is a system where resource pooling without preexisting trust relationships
should never happens or at least isn't planned by design.
It's assumed that all the nodes of one system are deployed at the capacities of one owner
and do not interact with other systems.

##### Secure nodeId assignment

> or to mediate all traffic to and from a victim node.

**Solution**: Introduce certificates, which bind a nodeId to public key.

> These certificates give the overlay a public key infrastructure,

> Certified nodeIds work well when nodes have fixed nodeIds.

Degitx nodeId is a hash from its public key, so this condition is met.

> While nodeId assignment by a CA ensures that nodeIds are chosen randomly.

It's needed to prevent attackers from easy chose of nodeId, when untrusted nodes are allowed to join. 

> it is also important to prevent an attacker from easily obtaining a large number of nodeId certificates.

Condition is met: Untrusted nodes aren't allowed to join. Attackers can only compromise a node.

> None of the known solutions to nodeId assignment are effective when the overlay network is very small.
> For small overlay networks, we must require that all members of the network are trusted not to cheat.
> Only when a network reaches a critical mass, 
> where it becomes sufficiently hard for an attacker 
> to muster enough resources to control a significant fraction of the overlay,
> should untrusted nodes be allowed to join.

This condition is also met.

> The CAs represent points of failure, vulnerable to both technical and legal attacks.

##### Secure routing table maintenance

> Systems without strong constraints on the set of nodeIds
> that can fill each routing table slot are more vulnerable to this attack.
> Pastry and Tapestry impose very weak constraints at the top levels of routing tables.
> This flexibility makes it hard to determine if routing updates are unbiased,
> but it allows these systems to effectively exploit network proximity
> to improve routing performance.

If attackers can't obtain signed nodeId, attacks on routing table are excluded, 
because node updates its routing table only from trusted nodes.

##### Secure message forwarding

If we own 100% of nodes, routing isn't under attack, we only need to
establish encrypted and authenticated channels between nodes via public key infrastructure.

### Conclusion
When the membership of a peer-to-peer system is constraint and all nodes are trusted,
CAs could solve all security issues because all attacks are based on malicious nodes presence.
