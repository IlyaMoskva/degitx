\begin{abstract}
Big software companies may have millions of code repositories,
and use them extensively by programmers and CI pipelines.
One git server is not able to satisfy performance expectations,
many servers with load-balancing can't solve this issue too because
of inability storage IO scaling for read operations.
Also, a big company may have distributed teams around the world,
where each team collaborates with others in one git repo,
cross-region repo access could be slow in such cases.
The solution for this problem is distributed git repository storage,
which replicates repositories across region nodes.

\section{The problem}

There was an attempt to implement POC distributed repository manager with
eventually consistency guarantee, but it fails because of two reasons:
1) fetch traffic correlates with push frequency because of huge amount of
CI systems involved in development process: each push event usually triggers
CI build which clones the repository.
2) push and fetch frequency is not distributed uniformly over the time: in each
repository, team members may have different responsibilities for review and merge process,
project technical lead can merge all approved pull-requests in short period of time
which causes frequent push operations in git repo.

These two conditions lead to high fetch traffic peaks for git repositories:
frequent push operations turn replication nodes into inconsistent state,
and lead to high fetch traffic from different regions to primary repository node
which can shutdown the node and become the whole repository unavailable for some time.

Merge is not the only way to ``update'' the repository. Lots of activities can do that,
here is the list of some:

\begin{description}
  \item[branches changing] \verb|create|/\verb|delete|/\verb|update| branches by git push or by using web page.
  \item[tags changing] \verb|create|/\verb|delete|/\verb|update| tags by git push or by releasing new version on web page.
  \item[special refs changing] when new merge request is created, a new\\
    \emph{\code{refs/merge-requests/IID\footnote{Internal id of a project on gitlab}/head}} named ref
    is created. When source branch of the merge request is updated, the ref is also updated.
  \item[migrations] sometimes repository administrator can migrate the repository to
    another physical device or another region node, it also could be treated as an update.
    Also, delete a repository could be treated as migrate it to a trash area.
\end{description}

\section{Solution}

The solution could be the implementation of distributed Git repository manager with
strong consistent replica nodes. It guarantees high availability across
different regions, durability by replicating repositories on different server racks,
read scalability by routing fetch traffic to different nodes.

DeGit is a peer-to-peer system, no persistent master nodes
exists\footnote{The system may have temporary master node for repository elected to perform git command}.
Each node knows about each other due to discovery protocol (\todo{choose discovery protocol}).

Each DeGit node stores multiple repositories on local storage
and exposes RPC API for all git operations. Node can accept RPC operation for repository
which is not located on local storage, in that case it performs lookup
for repository on other nodes and synchronizes it on local storage, and performs RPC command
after that.

When a new repository is created in a system, the node replicates this repository
to at least 3 other nodes synchronously and propagetes metadata for future repository lookup.

Update operation can be routed to any node which contains the repository. The node synchronously
updates all replicas on push. If update failed due to concurency issue, the whole update fails.

Each node collects usage statistics about fetch and push operation, and system may decide to move repositories
to most frequently used nodes based on this statistics.

The system autmatically rebalances repository storage: when repository is not used actively for a
long time, the node can remove a repository from storage if 3 replicas of this repository exists on other nodes;
if some node has a lot of free space on storage, and storage of another node is almost full,
full node can transfer (move) some repositories to another node, and IOPS of storage device is also
a importance measure.

The system can accept new nodes and automatically fill it with replica repository and
move some repository to new node. Same for disconnecting: if node was disconnected from the system or crashed,
it creates additional replicas on nodes to have at least 3 replicas for each repository in a system.

\subsection{Protocol}
Main system protocol components are (under discussion):
\begin{description}
  \item[Locators] - unique node identity.
  \item[Network] - node peers connection.
  \item[Discovery] - a mapping of repository to node: a node contains many repositories and
    repository can be replicated across many nodes.
  \item[Git data] - Git objects and references exchange protocol, commands to add new objects and update references.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Locators}
Each node has persistant public and private keys to identify itself in a system.
Unique identifier\footnote{In this document, node identifier, node-id and node locator refer to the same definition}
is a cryptographic hash of public key of the node in \emph{\href{https://multiformats.io/multihash/}{Multihash}} format.
Private and public keys can be used to sign requests to other nodes or to build trusted \emph{\hyperref[sec:discovery]{discovery}}
point in a system: when a new system is created, administrator can create CA (certification authority) for issuing
digital certificates for node public keys, so each node will be able to verify certificate of any other node when
using seed list URLs. Node instances uses locators to talk with each other, it can find real network address of nodes using
this identity. Also, system uses locators for node-repository mapping, the item of mapping table consists of
locator and unique repository name.

Identities and Network design of IPFS by J. Benet.

\subsubsection{Network}
DeGitX uses TCP or UDP protocols for transport layer, TCP is used by default. It uses IPv4 or IPv6 for addressing,
it stores addresses in \href{https://github.com/multiformats/multiaddr}{multiaddr} format, for instance:
\code{/ipv4/1.2.3.4/udp/4444} evaluates to \code{4444} UDP port on \code{1.2.3.4} IPv4 address.
DeGitX uses a routing system to find addresses of nodes by locators.

\subsubsection{Discovery}
\label{sec:discovery}
Repository mapping could be stored in distributed hash table (e.g. Kademlia),
\todo{research and compare different solutions}.

Consensus could be implemented using \emph{\href{https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf}{Raft}} or
\emph{\href{http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/pinewiki/Paxos.html}{Paxos}} algorithm.

\subsection{Git Internals}
\subsubsection{Dictionary}
\label{subsec:git-internals}
\begin{description}
  \item[Git] is a simple key-value data store and stores 3 main types of Objects: blob, tree, commit, and one additional: tag.
  \item[Blob] - content of file w/o filename.
  \item[Tree] - A single tree object contains one or more entries, each of which is the SHA-1 hash of a blob or subtree with its associated mode, type, and filename.
  For example, the most recent tree in a project may look something like this:\\
  \\
  \code{\$ git cat-file -p master\^\{tree\}}\\
  \code{100644 blob a906cb2a4a904a152e80877d4088654daad0c859      README}\\
  \code{100644 blob 8f94139338f9404f26296befa88755fc2598c289      Rakefile}\\
  \code{040000 tree 99f1a6d12cb4b6f19c8655fca46c3ecf317074e0      lib}
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{data-model-1.png}
    \label{fig:tree-objects}
  \end{figure}
  \item [Commit] is just a pointer to parent(previous) commit if any
  and to top-level tree for current one with some metadata
  (the author information and so on).
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{data-model-3.png}
    \label{fig:commit-objects}
  \end{figure}
\end{description}

{\large Other things, listed below, serve to make our interaction with these objects easier.
}
\begin{description}
  \item[Reference] - A file in which you could store SHA-1 value
  of a commit under a simple name, so you could use that simple name
  rather than the raw SHA-1 value.
  \item[Branch] is a simple pointer or reference to the head of a line of work(the latest commit) in .git/refs/heads.
  Branch name is mapped to the SHA of the commit that is latest for this branch.
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{data-model-4.png}
    \label{fig:reference}
  \end{figure}
  When you run commands like \code{git branch <branch>},
  Git basically runs update-ref command to add the SHA-1
  of the last commit of the branch you're on into whatever
  new reference you want to create.
  So create branch is just create a reference to some commit.
  And delete branch is only delete reference.
  After branch deletion, all its objects will be available via their SHA.
  The same is for other reference under .git/refs
  \item[HEAD] Usually the HEAD file is a symbolic reference to the branch
  you're currently on.
  By symbolic reference, we mean that unlike a normal reference,
  it contains a pointer to another reference.\\
  If you look at the file, you'll normally see something like this:\\
  \\
  \code{\$ cat .git/HEAD}\\
  \code{ref: refs/heads/master}\\
  \\If you run \code{git checkout branch}, Git updates the file to look like this:\\
  \\
  \code{\$ cat .git/HEAD}\\
  \code{ref: refs/heads/test}\\

  When you run \code{git commit}, it creates the commit object,
  specifying the parent of that commit object to be whatever SHA-1 value
  the reference in HEAD points to.
  This commit also becomes a new head for a current branch.
  refs/heads/<branch-name> will be updated and map to the SHA
  of this new commit.
  When you do \code{git reset HEAD~1},
  it also only update refs/heads/<branch-name>.
  It takes SHA of parent commit of current head commit.
  \item[Tag (lightweight)] It's like a branch reference, but it never moves - it always points to the same commit but gives it a friendlier name.\\
  You can create, update and delete such a tag, and no objects would be affected.
  It's only a reference.
  \item[Tag (annotated)] - tag object, that points to commit or any other object amd contains metadata, and a reference to this tag object.

  Use \code{git push --follow-tags} if you want to push your annotated tag to remote repo.
  To delete a tag on your local repository, you can use \code{git tag -d <tagname>}.
  To delete a remote tag: \code{git push origin --delete <tagname>}.

  Both operation only delete a reference in .git/refs/tag.
  Tag object wouldn't be removed.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Git file storage internals}

\textbullet\textbf{\large{ loose object storage}}\\

As we metioned, a git repository take cares of several types of objects:
\code{blob}, \code{tree}, \code{commit}, \code{tag}. Let's take a look at the details of object storage:\\

git default write the objects to directory \code{GIT\_DIR\footnote{the .git directory}/objects}.
Each object is named by a sha1 value for example \emph{\code{b98191cf971f2418e42877410a6c40fc112a0a93}}\\
it's storage path will be
\begin{center}
\emph{\code{GIT\_DIR/objects/b9/8191cf971f2418e42877410a6c40fc112a0a93}}
\end{center}
the directories under \code{GIT\_DIR/objects} is named by \code{SHA[0,2]} of objects' sha1 value,
this can avoid too much files in one directory because some filesystem has the max link number of files,
such as ext3 has the definition:
\begin{flushleft}
  \code{include/linux/ext3\_fs.h:\#define EXT3\_LINK\_MAX           32000}
\end{flushleft}

One object file is consist of three portions:
\begin{description}
  \item[type] can be one of `blob', `tree', `commit', `tag'
  \item[size] the number of bytes of the content
  \item[content] the content of object
\end{description}

and the object file will be compressed using zlib:

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node at (0,0.25) {binary};
  \node at (4,0.25) {\code{7370 6163 657d 0a5c ...}};
  \draw (1,0) rectangle (7,0.5);
  \node at (3.1,1.25) {compress};
  \draw[-latex] (2,1.5) -- (2,1);
  \node at (0,2.25) {buffer};
  \node at (1.5,2.25) {type};
  \node at (3.5,2.25) {size};
  \node at (6,2.25) {content};
  \draw (1,2) rectangle (2.95,2.5);
  \draw (3,2) rectangle (4.95,2.5);
  \draw (5,2) rectangle (10,2.5);
\end{tikzpicture}

the compression level can be set by `\textbf{\code{core.compression}}' or `\textbf{\code{core.loosecompression}}'.
\\

\textbullet\textbf{\large{ pack file storage}}\\

When we do \emph{\code{git gc}} or \emph{\code{git repack}}, pack files with the suffix \code{.pack}
maybe be created under directory \emph{\code{GIT\_DIR/objects/pack}}. A pack is a collection of objects,
individually compressed, with delta compression applied, stored in a single file, with an associated
index file. Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup engines, disk storage, etc.

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily]
$ tree .git/objects/pack
.git/objects/pack
|-- pack-24fcb83682e5a2848ef7bd00a9eda0bff1a372fc.idx
|-- pack-24fcb83682e5a2848ef7bd00a9eda0bff1a372fc.pack
|-- pack-915d8b4ae03b03179912c589cee932e5a990b7f0.idx
|-- pack-915d8b4ae03b03179912c589cee932e5a990b7f0.pack
|-- ...
\end{lstlisting}

Conceptually there are only four object types in a pack file: commit, tree, tag and blob.
However to save space, an object could be stored as a ``delta'' of another ``base'' object.
These representations are assigned new types \code{ofs-delta} and \code{ref-delta}.

\begin{description}
  \item[delta object]
    Both ofs-delta and ref-delta store the ``delta'' to be applied to another object
    (called `base object') to reconstruct the object. The difference between them is,
    ref-delta directly encodes 20-byte base object name. If the base object is in the same pack,
    ofs-delta encodes the offset of the base object in the pack instead.
  \item[base object]
    The base object could also be deltified if it's in the same pack.
    Ref-delta can also refer to an object outside the pack. When stored on disk however,
    the pack should be self contained to avoid cyclic dependency.
\end{description}

And usualy we have lots of versions of a single file in a repository, a new pack file will
store the last version's content as the base object, and computes the earlier versioins to
to be delta objects and store them referring to the base object:

\begin{tikzpicture}
  % loose objects

Usually objects contained in the pack are compressed using zlib, the compression level
can be set by `\textbf{\code{core.compression}}' or `\textbf{\code{pack.compression}}'.

When objects contained in the pack are stored using delta compression. The objects
are first internally sorted by type, size and optionally names and compared against
the other objects to see if using delta compression saves space. `\textbf{\code{pack.depth}}'
limits the maximum delta depth; Making it too deep affects the performance on the unpacker side,
because delta data needs to be applied that many times to get to the necessary object.
\\

To quickly find objects in the pack file, an associated index file is created with the
\emph{\href{https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/technical/pack-format.txt\#L161}{format}},
And `\emph{\code{git index-pack}}' can be used to regenerate the *.idx file on the *.pack file.
\\

\textbullet\textbf{\large{ when pack file is created}}\\

When we talk about the pack files, we said that packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems,
backup engines, disk storage, etc. So pack files will created in several scenes:

\begin{description}
  \item[git gc] `\emph{\code{git gc}}' runs a number of housekeeping tasks within the repository,
    such as compressing file revisions (to reduce disk space and increase performance), removing
    unreachable objects which may have been created from prior git commands.
    We can run it manually, and it may create a new pack file.
  \item[git repack] `\emph{\code{git repack}}' is used to combine all objects that do not currently
    reside in a pack file into a pack. It can also be used to re-organize existing packs into
    a single, more efficient pack.
  \item[git push] `\emph{\code{git push}}' will run \code{send-pack} to connects to the remote side,
    it gets one file descriptor which is either a socket (over the network) or a pipe (local).
    What's written to this file descriptor goes to `\emph{\code{git-receive-pack}}' to be unpacked.
    We can get the following pipeline flow from\\
    \emph{\href{https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/technical/send-pack-pipeline.txt}{Documentation/technical/send-pack-pipeline.txt}}:
    \begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily]
    send-pack
       |
       pack_objects() --> fd --> receive-pack
          | ^ (pipe)
          v |
       (child)
    \end{lstlisting}
    so we can see that `\emph{\code{git push}}' will create a pack file and send it to the remote side.
  \item[git-receive-pack] As menthioned above, `\emph{\code{git-receive-pack}}' will receive a pack file
    from `\emph{\code{git push}}'. And `\emph{\code{git receive-pack}}' will also forked a child
    `\emph{\code{git gc --auto --quiet}}' to check if there are too many loose objects to pack.
    Ususaly the threshold is 6700 loose files, we can set it by `\textbf{\code{gc.auto}}'.
  \item[git-upload-pack] When clients runs `\emph{\code{git clone}}' or `\emph{\code{git fetch}}', the
    client connects to the remote side and invokes `\emph{\code{git-upload-pack}}'.
    `\emph{\code{git-upload-pack}}' will communicate with client and compute how many objects the client
    want then fork and exec child `\emph{\code{git-pack-objects}}' to create a pack file for all the
    needed objects and pipe the pack file to client.
    \begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily]
    upload-pack
       |
       pack_objects() --> fd --> fetch-pack
          | ^ (pipe)
          v |
       (child)
    \end{lstlisting}

    We can also use the `\textbf{\code{repack.writeBitmaps}}' to let git write a bitmap index when packing
    all objects to disk (e.g., when git repack -a is run). This index can speed up the "counting
    objects" phase of subsequent packs created for clones and fetches, at the cost of some disk space
    and extra time spent on the initial repack.

\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:requirements}

\subsection{Features}
\label{sec:features}

The most critical
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement}{Non-functional requirements}
are:

\begin{description}
  \item[Read scalability]
    The solution should scale out the read capacity of a system, each region should be able
    to access repository using most available replica node.
  \item[Strong consistency]
    All? (\todo{discuss, maybe not all but the majority of replicas})
    active replica repositories should be synchronized on updates in any node
    with immediate consistency.
  \item[Durability]
    The system must have enough replicas to recover itself in case of corruption.
    Corrupted repository could be responsible for recovering itself using replica nodes.
  \item[Self management (rename?)]
    Each node performs cleanup when needed (\code{git gc}) and may remove replica
    from storage on read inactivity.
    A node should be able to find and synchronize new repository on read,
    after that it should be up to date on new updates.
  \item[Maintainability]
    Node administrator can change the storage, and perform data migration from one storage
    to another.
    Repository administrators are able to add or delete node for new region and
    get all nodes status for repository.
  \item[Auditability]
    Node doesn't perform access control operations, but logs all
    requests with identity and performed operation.
  \item[Analytics]
    Node collects statistics for each repository and usage metrics, such as
    push and pull operations, etc. The system keeps the whole statistics about
    nodes, e.g. how many nodes contains each repository, the state of nodes, etc.
\end{description}

\section{Compare to other solutions}

These products are similar to DeGit by some aspects:
\begin{description}
  \item[Spokes]
    GitHub announced \href{https://github.blog/2016-04-05-introducing-dgit/}{DGit}
    in 2016 (renamed to \href{https://github.blog/2016-09-07-building-resilience-in-spokes/}{Spokes})
    where they \href{https://github.blog/2016-09-07-building-resilience-in-spokes/#defining-resilience}{pay attention}
    to the consistency:
    \begin{quote}
      Spokes puts the highest priority on consistency and partition tolerance.
      In worst-case failure scenarios, it will refuse to accept writes that it cannot commit,
      synchronously, to at least two replicas.
    \end{quote}
    It's a proprietary software that can't be used for free and the source code is closed.
    Spokes papers claims that it pays attention to consistency, but on the
    \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY0yNRNkYb0}{conference talk} they mentioned that
    it's rarely possible to break the consistency which requires manual intervention.
    Therefore the approach of distributed system design used by Spokes is not suitable for open
    source project, where maintainance team doesn't exist.
  \item[Gitaly]
    \href{https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/README.html}{Gitlab} has
    \href{https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/}{Gitaly} service which provides
    \code{gRPC} API for Gitlab website and git-ssh proxy to perform all git operations via API.
    It's \href{https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly}{open source} component.
    Gitaly proposed new design for service which claims to provide
    \href{https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/blob/master/doc/design\_ha.md\#strong-consistency-design}{strong concistency}
    but in fact it doesn't provide linearability of commands in system \todo{arguments and proves}.
    Futhermore, it's possible that GitLab may change HA licensing \todo{find cases},
    or restrict HA support \href{https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21437334}{based on country residence}.
  \item[JGit]
    \href{https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/}{Jgit} is a Java git server created by \href{https://www.eclipse.org/}{Eclipse}.
    Google \href{https://www.eclipse.org//lists/jgit-dev/msg03073.html}{contributed} to this project with Ketch module:
    \begin{quote}
      Git Ketch is a multi-master Git repository management system. Writes
      (such as git push) can be started on any server, at any time. Writes
      are successful only if a majority of participant servers agree.
      Acked writes are durable against server failure, due to a majority of
      the participants storing all required objects.
    \end{quote}
    But this is the only place where Ketch is mentioned. \todo{Analyze source code of Ketch module}.
  \item[IPFS]
    \href{https://ipfs.io/}{IPFS} is not exactly distributed git repository project, but has similar ideas
    and cound be helpfull for us. \todo{analyze IPFS project}.
  \item[brig]
    \todo{analyze the project} \href{https://github.com/sahib/brig}{brig}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:nfr}

The most important \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_requirement}{functional requirements} are:

\begin{description}
  \item[Front end]
    The system potentically may have different kinds of front-ends,
    but it's required to support \href{https://grpc.io/}{gRPC}
    of \href{https://about.gitlab.com/}{GitLab} to integrate the system
    into GitLab service and replace
    \href{https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/}{Gitaly}.
  \item[Back end]
    Each node may be connected to different types of storage for git repos,
    but it's required to support file-system storage.
\end{description}

\subsection{Expected Metrics}
\label{ref:metrics}

In a large enterprise it is expected to have the following
numbers, in terms of load, size, and speed:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
  Repositories & 2M \\
  Active users & 100K/day \\
  Merges & 100K/day \\
  Fetches & 15M/day, 15K/m - peak \\
  Push & 200K/day \\
  Traffic - download & 200Tb/day \\
  Traffic - update & 250Gb/day \\
\end{tabular}
